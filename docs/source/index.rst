experiment-design allows anyone to easily create and extend randomized experiment designs. Currently, it supports
creating designs using

- Random sampling
- `Latin hypercube sampling <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latin_hypercube_sampling>`_
- Orthogonal sampling

Experiment variables can be discrete and continuous as well as correlated. experiment-design can handle all of these
cases and seeks to provide a space-filling design of experiments with small correlation error.
